# tac.pl6

Create a script that is the reverse of 'cat' in that it will print the lines
from a given input file in reverse order:

```
$ cat input.txt
foo
bar
baz
quux
$ ./tac.pl6 input.txt
quux
baz
bar
foo
```

The script should accept a single unnamed "input" argument that should be a 
file.  If provided no arguments, the script should produce a "usage" 
statement:

```
$ ./tac.pl6
Usage:
  ./tac.pl6 <input>
```

If provided an argument that is not a file, it should die with the message
"Not a file":

```
$ ./tac.pl6 foo

Not a file (foo)
  in sub MAIN at ./tac.pl6 line 4
  in block <unit> at ./tac.pl6 line 3
```

A passing test suite should look like this:

```
$ make test
./test.pl6
1..3
ok 1 - No args gives usage
ok 2 - Bad arg gives usage
ok 3 - Correct output
```

If you "make jabber," you should see this:

```
  And the mome raths outgrabe.
All mimsy were the borogoves,
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

  He chortled in his joy.
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!'
  Come to my arms, my beamish boy!
"And, has thou slain the Jabberwock?

  He went galumphing back.
He left it dead, and with its head
  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
One, two! One, two! And through and through

  And burbled as it came!
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
And, as in uffish thought he stood,

  And stood awhile in thought.
So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
  Long time the manxome foe he sought --
He took his vorpal sword in hand:

  The frumious Bandersnatch!"
Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!

  And the mome raths outgrabe.
All mimsy were the borogoves,
  Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:
'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves

JABBERWOCKY -- Lewis Carroll
