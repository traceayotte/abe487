C_HW3 

Edit the existing 'greeting.pl6' file to take a single, positional (not named)
argument called 'name.'  If you type 'make,' it will execute the script with
$USER like so:

```
$ make
./greeting.pl6 kyclark
Hello, kyclark, your name has 7 characters.
$ ./greeting.pl6 "John Coltrane"
Hello, John Coltrane, your name has 13 characters.
```

The argument you are getting from the command line is a string, so you 
will want to read the docs on the "Str" type:

https://docs.perl6.org/type/Str

If your program is given no arguments, it should print a "usage" statement.
If you use the "MAIN" subroutine with a proper signature, this will happen
automatically; otherwise, you will need to handle this yourself.
