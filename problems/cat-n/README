# Assignment

Write a bash script that mimics "cat -n" where you print the line number 
before each line of input from a given file.  E.g.:

```
$ ./cat-n.sh input.txt
1 foo
2 bar
```

If no arguments (files) are given, it should print a "usage" statement:

```
$ ./cat-n.sh
Usage: cat-n.sh file
```

You only need to worry about processing one file.

# Testing

When the script is not working, "make test" will show something like this:

```
$ make test
./test.pl6
not ok 1 - Prints usage

# Failed test 'Prints usage'
# at ./test.pl6 line 9
not ok 2 - Correct output

# Failed test 'Correct output'
# at ./test.pl6 line 13
# expected: '1 foo
# 2 bar
# '
#      got: 'OK
# '
make: *** [test] Error 2
```

Your program is correct when you see this output:

```
$ make test
./test.pl6
ok 1 - Prints usage
ok 2 - Correct output
```
